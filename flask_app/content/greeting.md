#About the Lab

We study the interplay between network topology and the dynamics of social interaction, using computational models, data from on-line networks, and laboratory experiments with human participants.

We are supported by grants from the [National Science Foundation](http://www.nsf.gov/) and the [MINERVA Initiative](http://minerva.dtic.mil/).
